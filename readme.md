input your orientation (+Z orthogonal to ground, +X compass north (true north)) and gives you a rotation matrix that is your difference from the ecliptic plane (+Z orthogonal, +X RA0), given the time and day and your location on Earth.

these are the missing set of functions required to build stargazing apps on mobile devices
